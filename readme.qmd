**Target Audience:** Advanced MSc and PhD students in Social Sciences.

**Prerequisites:**

- Basic to intermediate proficiency in Python (understanding data types, lists, dictionaries, loops, functions) (see below for resources).
- Familiarity with the Jupyter Notebook or a similar Python IDE (see below for resources).
- A conceptual understanding of social science research methodologies.

**Workshop Goal:** Equip students with the skills to programmatically access data from public REST APIs, transform this data into analysis-ready datasets, and critically consider dataset design for social science research.
